# Agent Auditor - Claude Code Configuration

This project uses the Agent Auditor package to audit AI agent specifications against industry best practices.

## Available Commands

### /audit-agent
Audit an entire agent specification against domain best practices.

**Usage:**
```
/audit-agent [package-path] [agent-name]
```

**Parameters:**
- `package-path`: Path to the agent package (e.g., `./projects/mark-method`)
- `agent-name`: Name of the agent to audit (e.g., `critic`, `pmm`)
- `depth` (optional): `standard` (10-15 sources) or `deep` (20+ sources)

**Example:**
```
/audit-agent ./projects/mark-method critic
```

### /audit-workflow
Deep-dive audit of a single workflow within an agent.

**Usage:**
```
/audit-workflow [package-path] [agent-name] [workflow-name]
```

**Example:**
```
/audit-workflow ./projects/mark-method critic /fact-check
```

### /research-topic
Gather best practices on a topic without auditing.

**Usage:**
```
/research-topic "[topic]"
```

**Example:**
```
/research-topic "B2B product positioning frameworks"
```

## Output Location

Reports are created at: `{{reports_path}}/`

**How file creation works:**
1. The agent generates the report and displays it for review
2. The agent asks for confirmation before saving
3. Upon confirmation, the file is created at the specified path
4. The agent confirms the file was created

```
{{reports_path}}/
├── agents/      # Full agent audit reports
├── workflows/   # Workflow-specific deep dives
└── research/    # Pure research briefs
```

## Research Depth

- **Standard (default):** 10-15 sources from Tier 1-2 (industry standards, expert practitioners)
- **Deep-dive:** 20+ sources including Tier 3 (academic/research)
